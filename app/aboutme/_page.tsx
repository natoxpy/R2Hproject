                  I was born in El Salvador. I lived there for 9 years before I
                  came to the United States in late 2015. I first came to Iowa,
                  but in 2017, I moved to Charlotte.

                  Most people know me for being very talkative. They would
                  likely never guess that I was born with a speech impediment.
                  When I was a little kid, I was diagnosed and received
                  treatment and therapy to be able to talk as I grew up. This
                  means that there was a chance I could have been mute now.

                  For a while, my only hobby was watching anime. I enjoyed
                  reading the stories or just watching the shows. The day I came
                  to the U.S., I began watching Pokemon and Dragon Ball and
                  became a fan of them.

                  When I was 13 years old, I purchased my first computer. Pretty
                  soon, I would realize that technology and I did not get along
                  very well. My first computer was something to laugh at, but
                  it&apos;s one I still hold dear to this day.

                  As frustrated as I felt by the poor performance of this
                  computer at the time, it was also the machine where I learned
                  my first lines of code. This was where it all began.

                  I started wanting to build a website, without any purpose or
                  reason, just blindly wanting to do something for fun. As you
                  all can probably understand, it&apos;s not such a simple task.
                  Learning HTML for the first time was a challenge because I had
                  no idea what I was doing or trying to do.

                  This blind motivation took me very far in my first few years
                  of coding. From the day I wrote my first line of code until
                  today, the longest break I have takenâ€”times when I did not
                  write a single line of codeâ€”has been about 2 months. In my 5
                  years of coding, a 2-month break was the longest, and before
                  that, the second longest was 3 weeks.

                  Doing this for so long, hundreds of thousands of hours deep
                  into this, coding has been my main hobby for years. It likely
                  won&apos;t stop anytime soon. I went from coding on a trashy
                  old laptop to a two-monitor setup with a gaming PC and my
                  recently purchased 80GB of RAM.

                  Another part of my software hobby is also building computer,
                  and configuring servers, I own 2 home servers and have another
                  2 server on the cloud, one of which is hosting this website.
